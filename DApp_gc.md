Example: Apple's Macbook Pitch
Why: We believe in challenging the status quo and thinking differently.
How: Our products are beautifully designed, simple to use, and user friendly.
What: We happen to make great computers. Want one?

## Why (in progress as of 1/23/2015)

Today’s world
*Imagine clocking into work today. You know you will be in the office from 9-5pm, and will get paid as long as you keep your boss happy. If you are one of the unlucky ones you have a drill sergeant for a boss, and end up taking lots of bathroom breaks and random walks to escape your boss's grip as he or she squeezes as much value as possible from you during your 9-5. If you are one of the lucky few then you don't have a boss looking over your shoulder and you fire up a cat video or two and end up doing 1 - 2 hours of work.

DApps World
What does a DApps world look like? #QUESTION

*Now begin to envision a DApps world - a world where organizations are coded in software and totally automated. A world where 

 ...and the sharing of your resources is rewarded with value. Imagine getting in your car in the morning, unlocking your smartphone, and with the tap of a button you tell the world that you are sharing the empty seats in your car and you are automatically matched with a friend who lives down the street, pick her up on your way, and instantly get rewarded in digital currency. #lazooz 

*Imagine traveling anywhere, opening your laptop, and gaining wifi access because you have tokens in your digital wallet that you earned by sharing your home wifi. #distributedwifi

*Imagine visiting your favorite social network, and every time you make a comment or create content that contributes to the network you immediately receive a reward. #ltb
